Incident Response Plan for Hungry Hustle 
1. Preparation 
Develop an Incident Response Team (IRT): Assign roles and responsibilities to team members. 
Create an Incident Response Plan (IRP): Document procedures for handling incidents. 
Train Employees: Conduct regular training sessions on security awareness and incident response. 
Implement Security Tools: Deploy tools like firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and antivirus 
software. 
2. Detection 
Monitor Systems: Use Splunk to continuously monitor network traffic and system logs for suspicious 
activities. 
Set Up Alerts: Configure alerts for unusual activities, such as multiple failed login attempts or data 
exfiltration. 
Regular Audits: Perform regular security audits and vulnerability assessments. 
3. Containment 
Immediate Containment: Isolate affected systems to prevent further damage. 
Short-Term Containment: Apply temporary fixes, such as blocking malicious IP addresses and 
disabling compromised accounts. 
Long-Term Containment: Implement more permanent solutions, such as patching vulnerabilities 
and enhancing security controls. 
4. Eradication 
Identify Root Cause: Use forensic analysis to determine the source and method of the breach. 
Remove Malware: Clean infected systems and remove any malicious code. 
Patch Vulnerabilities: Apply patches to fix security flaws and prevent re-exploitation. 
5. Recovery 
Restore Systems: Recover systems from clean backups and ensure they are fully operational. 
Monitor Systems: Continue to monitor systems for any signs of residual threats. 
Validate Security: Conduct thorough testing to ensure that all vulnerabilities have been addressed. 
6. Lessons Learned 
Post-Incident Review: Conduct a review meeting to discuss what happened, what was done well, 
and what could be improved. 
Update IRP: Revise the incident response plan based on lessons learned. 
Implement Improvements: Apply the insights gained to enhance security measures and prevent 
future incidents. 
Specific Actions for Addressing the Data Breach 
Immediate Actions: 
• Isolate affected systems. 
• Notify stakeholders and regulatory bodies. 
• Begin forensic analysis to identify the breach source. 
Short-Term Actions: 
• Block malicious IP addresses. 
• Reset passwords for affected accounts. 
• Apply patches to vulnerable systems. 
Long-Term Actions: 
• Enhance monitoring and logging. 
• Conduct regular security training. 
• Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA). 
Methods for Identifying and Analyzing the Source of the Breach 
Log Analysis: Use Splunk to analyze logs for unusual activities and trace the attack path. 
Network Traffic Analysis: Monitor network traffic for signs of data exfiltration or communication with 
malicious servers. 
Forensic Tools: Utilize forensic tools to examine compromised systems and identify malware or other 
indicators of compromise (IOCs). 
Recommendations for Mitigating Future Incidents 
Short-Term Strategies: 
• Implement MFA for all accounts. 
• Conduct regular vulnerability assessments. 
• Enhance email security to prevent phishing attacks. 
Long-Term Strategies: 
• Develop a comprehensive security awareness program. 
• Invest in advanced threat detection and response tools. 
• Establish a continuous improvement process for security policies and procedures. 
Threat Intelligence Recommendations 
Policies and Processes for Threat Intelligence 
Threat Intelligence Program: Establish a formal threat intelligence program to collect, analyze, and 
act on threat data. 
Sources of Intelligence: Utilize multiple sources, including open-source intelligence (OSINT), 
commercial threat feeds, and information sharing with industry peers. 
Threat Analysis: Regularly analyze threat data to identify trends and emerging threats. 
Actionable Intelligence: Translate threat intelligence into actionable measures, such as updating 
f
irewall rules or blocking malicious IP addresses. 
Addressing Recent Breaches and Vulnerabilities 
Example of Actionable Intelligence: 
Phishing Campaign: If threat intelligence indicates a rise in phishing attacks, implement email 
f
iltering and train employees to recognize phishing attempts. 
Zero-Day Vulnerability: If a new zero-day vulnerability is discovered, apply virtual patching and 
monitor for exploitation attempts. 
Sharing intelligence: This method can help the platform to be updated on trends or new ways to 
exploit vulnerabilities in the system, there are several platforms that should be continuously 
reviewed such as IBM X-FORCE Exchange, splunk (which we are using at the moment) or CrowdStrike 
Falcon X.
